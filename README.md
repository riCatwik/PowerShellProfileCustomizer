# PowerShell Profile Customizer

This VS Code extension customizes your PowerShell profile to change the prompt display. The new prompt displays the current directory on one line, followed by a `>` symbol on the next, making it more visually separated and easier to read.

## Features

- Automatically updates the PowerShell profile upon activation.
- Makes the PowerShell prompt in the integrated terminal more readable.

## Requirements

- Windows OS with PowerShell installed.
- A valid PowerShell profile. If one doesn't exist, the extension will create it.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace or by manually adding the `.vsix` file.
2. Upon activation, the extension will automatically modify the PowerShell profile.
3. Open a new PowerShell terminal in VS Code to see the changes.

## Known Issues

- Please make sure to back up your PowerShell profile before using the extension.
