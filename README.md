# Terminal Customizer for VSCode

This VS Code extension customizes your PowerShell, Windows PowerShell, and Command Prompt profiles to change the prompt display. The new prompt displays the current directory on one line, followed by a `>` symbol on the next, making it more visually separated and easier to read.

## Features

- Customizes the profiles for PowerShell, Windows PowerShell, and Command Prompt upon activation.
- Makes the prompt in the integrated terminal more readable.

## Requirements

- Windows OS with PowerShell or Command Prompt installed.
- A valid PowerShell, Windows PowerShell, or Command Prompt profile. If one doesn't exist, the extension will create it.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace or by manually adding the `.vsix` file.
2. Activate the extension, and it will automatically modify the profiles for PowerShell, Windows PowerShell, and Command Prompt.
3. Open a new terminal in VS Code to see the changes.

### Special Instructions for Command Prompt Customization

For the Command Prompt customization to take effect, the `AutoRun` key in the Windows Registry might need modification.

#### If the `AutoRun` Key is Present

1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`.
3. Double-click the `AutoRun` key. In the "Value data" field:

   - If it's empty, input the path to your `cmdProfile.cmd`, typically:

     ```
     "C:\Users\<YourUsername>\cmdProfile.cmd"
     ```

   - If there's an existing value, append the path for `cmdProfile.cmd` to the end. For example:

     ```
     "existing_commands" & "C:\Users\<YourUsername>\cmdProfile.cmd"
     ```

#### If the `AutoRun` Key is Not Present

1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`.
3. Right-click on the `Command Processor` folder, select `New`, and then choose `String Value`.
4. Rename the new string value to `AutoRun`.
5. Double-click the `AutoRun` string value. In the "Value data" field, input the path to your `cmdProfile.cmd`, typically:

   ```
   "C:\Users\<YourUsername>\cmdProfile.cmd"
   ```

**Note:** Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual Windows username.

Ensure you're careful while editing the Windows Registry; incorrect changes can affect system behavior.
